having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me i am m and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind not even crushes i lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff ive never even had female friends except some cousins i live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm im nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious especially for women but i dont see myself ever getting married ill probably kms before it feels like i will miss out on this part of the human experience because im so insecure around women i saw a post that summarised how i feel perfectly gti have trouble talking to women in fact i cant even make eye contact with them especially if i find them even a little attractive im scared theyll think i like them and then theyll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them i know that going into a relationship wont fix me but its so gut wrenching knowing that you dont have the skills or prospects that can make it possible its stopping me from even trying to make friends with women if they think i like them theyll probably be disgusted by me even though im scared to even let myself think that i might like someone i know that i should try to make friends with women first but im afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women let alone having female friends or a relationship its like i carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and i automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it is there anyone out here who knows what this is like,personality_disorder,personality_disorder,personality_disorder

hair fall so ive posted here before regarding my hair loss issue i mentioned in my previous post that i have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result i have bald patches some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so i visited another dermatologist today she was able to diagnose my problem she said i have a very severe hair loss at a very early age im only the problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia she said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald its probably due to an harmonal imbalance so im wondering is there anyone who suffered from a similar problem and how did they manage to recover their hair,anxiety,anxiety,anxiety

neuroscience of bipolar i am a total hopless nerd what helps me probably the most with bipolar besides meds duh is understanding what the medications actually do i have binders full of detailed notes i take on different classes of psychopharmaceuticals its so fascinating how people with different brain chemistries react so differently to various meds for some reason the chemical perspective helps me understand it all so much better it also helps to explain it to normies ive found and with work ive done on emotional awareness it feels like i can tell when something is emotional versus caused by brain chemicals of course there is overlap after things like exercise sex caffeine anything that gets them neurotransmitters moving i feel hyper aware of my chemical state i can feel the the fall and the rise its just when i let my chemicals get so off balance that i get manic or depressed and then this logical view is fucked lol this was kind of random but it consumes a lot of my thoughts are there any other bipolar science nerds out there any thoughts or do you have certain scientific perspectives that help you understand this illness,bipolar,bipolar,bipolar

im not sure how much more disappointment i can takeive been unemployed for just over six months and i am on my last week of benefits i was fired from an abusive confusing and stressful job that i ultimately hated despite always putting in serious effort and insane hours since then it has been difficult to find a job at my level or even below my level due to my lack of a bachelors degree and the fact that i was terminated from my previous position my good name was tarnished at my previous job by one of my subordinates who manipulated several situations with my bosses to get me fired and gaslighted me the entire time we worked together that person then took my position at the company that person has since been fired for trying to do the same thing with other employees but the damage has been done to me a car that i am financing and paying a high amount for insurance is unreliable and has some sort of electrical issue i cant afford to even have evaluated let alone fixed my other vehicle is so old and rare that parts cant even be found for it anymore so im just waiting for the day that it decides to call it quits on me ive been applying for lowerlevel receptionist positions in the same field but still getting picked over mind you ive hired people for these kinds of positions in this small town and thats the most insulting part i know the types of people that apply for these positions most of them cant spell i guess you could say that i feel like im better than this and mostly better than the competition i know that sounds elitist entitled and unprofessional i have never said anything like this out loud and would never admit to it outside a throwaway account its toxic and its not how i present myself ever thats just what the last few months have done to me my spouse is older than me and i went into this marriage several years ago with full knowledge of his health conditions unfortunately things have taken several negative turns in the last few months and im currently trying to get him an appointment in the city since there is no one here to adequately treat him thats about mi round trip which means gas i have to pay for and excessive wear on my vehicle i very recently started applying for part time work at hotels front desk custodial etc and cant get an interview until the beginning of next month by which time ill be broke my dad is pretty useless and ruined my moms credit when i was a child so buildingprotecting my credit has been paramount ive still never missed any payments but my score has dropped into the s since i have only been making minimum payments and allowed some balances to grow my overall debt isnt that bad but it is suffocating me right now and i cant fathom going delinquent on anything i have two cards that im late on already and im not sure how im gonna handle that i dont want to be a loser it seems really silly for me to care so much about my debt but ive spent my life always doing the right thing everything just seems so unfair to me right now and if that isnt bad enough my cynical entitled thoughts are making it worse i can start off in a good mood but even the most minor of inconveniences and disappointments can send me into a downward spiral of hopelessness i dont want to die i guess i just want to stop existing,suicide,suicide,suicide

my observations from moving from a low end phone to a midrange so my comparison is from the mobicell hype to the vivo y so the first thing i noticed is that the y is considerably heavier than the hype as well as the battery life being way better on the y although this is expected as thats the main selling point of the phone another thing is how smooth using the y is compared to the hype and just the wide amount of games you can play with on the y that you cant with the hype i cant really compare the feeling you have on the devices as my dad wants me to keep the y in its case the sad thing about getting the y is that it has a better processer than my laptop octa core on the y vs the quad core well thats my analysis of the difference between a low and a midrange phone sorry for any grammarspelling mistakes i am currently using my phone to type this out,non_suicide,anxiety,non_suicide
lumps on neck and head now okay so first of all thank you for reading this i am struggling with bad anxiety right now i have had two lumps on the side of my neck for years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing i was put on antibiotics which didnt seem to help and sent away i recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound which i have yet to go to to make sure they werent cancer i have zero symptoms otherwise fast forward to now i have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp im trying to tell myself its just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go its larger than the other two and is hard and hurts a little when i apply pressure there are a few causes i can think of its just a cyst and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes my fathet has a history of cysts which may account for mine im pretty sure i remember hitting my head on something about a week ago so it could just be a bruise of sorts memory isnt clear cancer im gonna die hit the panic button ect i recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react this is the way my anxious mind sees it i must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two ive had for years ive left it untreated for so long that im scared to even go to a doctor now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable i will get brain cancer and die at due to my lack of action im honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality im hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not im blowing this out of proportion thank you im also worried that in trying to niaevely make myself feel better by posting this,anxiety,anxiety,anxiety

this touches some minor religious topics so if youre sensitive to that be warned this is actually about a friendship type relationship but i think this flair fits i got a friend who is part of a big corrupt church and he is really loyal to it what this church does is say to their people that they should give a big part of their salary to the church because they should rely completely and exclusively on god and not on material things they do that every months i think and after the person is completely drained and has no money to donate that person becomes an outcast turns into a bad person because they cant give any more money to the church i never was part of it but ive gone there a few times since my friend invited me for some events and judging by the extremely expensive buildings all around the country and the fancy props they use i was getting suspicious that suspicion became true after a famous model from here confirmed all that i said and is now forming a lawsuit against their lies now back to my friend he and his family have been loyal to that church as long as i can remember i want to help him but i am afraid that if i say that to him he will think i am a bad person and am against god yes the church does that and he will keep going to the church but in his eyes i will be his enemy what am i supposed to do in this situation,non_suicide,religion_cb,non_suicide

overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and i have to come up with responses on the spot there is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations or when someone is trying to sell something to you so before these situations i often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it this makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison there are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it for example suppose i was buying something from a shop i hand over my money and then the shop keeper just ignores me what can i actually do in that situation call the cops get a lawyer what proof do i have that the money was mine and i handed it over what obliges the shop keeper to give me the item i wanted normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place theyve never been burned by it so it just works for them but here i am worrying over every little thing that id rather hide away from it all if possible,personality_disorder,personality_disorder,personality_disorder

root of avpd and lifedamaging thoughts i had m my problem with avpd is that it made me weak defenseless i feel like prey living among predators my self esteem is low and i know how it can be increased it just requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear i was bullied by two different group of people i realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness the second time i was bullied by my friends at that time initially they even respected me cause i was serious but when you cant defend yourself it looks pathetic and i even can see their perspective you just need to be more tough and confident without any reason this experience reflected in my thoughts i was living with till recently when i was a kid i thought you need to really know how to dance know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it cause how they being so stupid could think about it really its not possible but they fuck i dont second was about clothes hypebeasts i thought classmates were making fun of me cause i looked weird lame even though its not fully wrong i just exaggerated it on a new extreme level there wasnt particularly anything wrong with my clothes i just couldnt understand their reaction third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that i missed or like there was some hidden context i was unaware of it was a constant thought when i was with my peers i also has such problem that i often cant decide when i should feel offended and when not its important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag this is also a beginning of my ppd part of personality this kind of thinking leads to paranoia i hope i wont regret posting this maybe its the only time i can be honest,personality_disorder,bipolar,personality_disorder

a month ago i was drugged without my consent long post tldr dad gave me edible without my knowledgeconsent i had a really bad trip now i dont know how to deal with it hey not sure if this is the best place to post this im not even sure what im looking for exactly to vent to know if someone had a similar experience i dont know last month i was staying at my dads house one night i was sitting in the living room while he and his wife were in the kitchen nearby i wasnt paying any attention to them i was playing a video game on my dads laptop i had headphones on with one ear uncovered because i was also watching the simpsons so i didnt know what they were talking about my dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy i dont remember if i asked what it was whether i did or not he was just like try it now the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isnt unusual im used to him making me try weird foods and such so perhaps foolishly i ate it without really questioning it it tasted vile it was only after i had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible now another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me once when i was a teenager for example he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didnt so i wasnt sure if he was lying or not i knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles i justdidnt know they had any at the time i had never done drugs before and i dont think i would have eaten it if i had known after that he and his wife went to bed about an hour or so passed then it began kicking in i started feeling dizzy and i got kind of scared so i went into their bedroom and i asked my dad if it really was an edible he said no this was a lie but obviously i didnt know it at the time i decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep there was only one bedroom so i had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner so i was lying there crying because i had no idea if what i was feeling was because i was high or if it was all in my head my dads wife was also high and she started talking to me i started laughing things got kind of funnyi started talking about all of my interests much to my dads annoyance as he was trying to sleep and i said some really embarrassing things i later found out he had recorded at least most of what i saidwell yelled cause apparently when im high i get really loud i have selective mutism so i tend to have a lot of trouble talking if im not really comfortable its gotten better over the years but my dad is convinced that i dont actually have it or something anyway at some point i fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare its hard to describe but it involved me forgetting everythingmy life my interests the people i knew and the world around mei dreamt that my dad knew i was going to forget it all and i remember the fear i felt in the nightmare just that feeling ofwhy why would he do this to me i tried to recall faces mine my dads a musician i have a crush on yeah weird i knowand everything was warped grotesque everything became a black void you know that scene in spongebob where squidwards in that alone place kind of like that except black instead of white i began thinking that maybe i had died or was dying and that this horrible void was the afterlife i woke up sobbing and screaming oh godoh lord over and over and also yelling at my dad how could you do this to me and i will never forgive you he and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that i was trying to wake up from my dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists american murder song in my disoriented state i remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar and that if i could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay i vaguely remember singing along to the songs after i ate he put on one of my favorite movies repo the genetic opera and left me in the living room i remember it being on but it felt almost like i was half asleep or something throughout i was just anxious and confused and i was trying to focus on the movie but i kepti dont know it was like going in and out of consciousness or something theres a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and i remember vaguely wondering if perhaps i was actually her im a guy not that it mattered to my drugged self and that i would wake up and the movie would be reality apparently i also sang along to the whole move but i dont remember this my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said i seemed to be having a great time but i know i really wasnt i do remember however that at some point i threw up all over myself after the movie i told my dad i threw up and he was mad that i was too disoriented to clean it up myself by this point about six hours had passed since i had taken the edible i remember being so confused i asked him what day it was after that i went back to sleep the next day my dad told me that it really was an edibleso i did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way but for about three days afterward i still felt the affects of itand for about a week or so i kept experience derealization my dads reason for giving me the ediblehe said he thought it would make me talk morewhich it did but it was humiliating apparently he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible but as my cousin pointed out to me its strange to just assume that id be paying attention to a conversation that i wasnt even part of even if i was in the room so he apparently thought i knew what it was i wasnt able to go home immediately he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that but when i eventually did i told my mom what happened shes furious at my dad though neither of us have spoken to him about it i talked to my therapist about it recently but her reaction seemeddismissive like she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests but againi had no consent so here i am exactly a month after it happenedi still experience derealization if i think about it parts of the nightmare i mentioned i literally only remembered last night i justi dont know how im going to get over this i dont know if im ever going to be able to for example watch repo againjust recently i listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach im trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dadthis isnt the first time ive thought about it to be honest but im seriously considering it now i just know now that thinking about that nightmare

do you have phases i do ive noticed a structure and pattern of my phases as it relates to my level of brain activity from depression to hypomania i hope sharing this will clarify these cycles for others i have a lot of phases of interest sometimes they reoccur sometimes theyre oneoffs its frustrating to be passionate about something and then stop but i know its because my moods change ive come to some observations about my phases and even have a little theory about them although it may just be limited to my case heres the theory my phases fall into four categories at the lowest level there is basic pleasures some basic pleasures ive had are baseball harry potter and disney movies next there is high pleasure eg classical music jazz music and shakespeare then i have phases of personal development losing weight learning musical skills learning spanish finally i have the highest order of phases where i have a sense of duty ive become vegan and buddhist out of this level i feel like these phases accord to a particular level of brain activity from low to high i think everyone falls somewhere on this dimension at a given moment i also think healthy people have a smaller average range of categories of particular interest some people skew basic to high some high to personal development some just are adept at acting on a sense of duty at least in my case i run the full gamut at a depressed level i have basic interests at a certain level of depression one my have no interest but i dont get that low at a hypomanic level i have a grandiose sense of duty however i feel like i have a natural balance i feel like i have an ideal scope like anyone else but i have no balance of brain activity i feel at my most me when i am at a mix of high pleasure and personal development ive also noticed a pattern of logical progression from disordered to ordered interest in my life say i start at my healthy level highdeveopment when i approach a sense of runaway personal development i become grandiose about that development then i may achieve a personal sense of duty to apply that development of course my deveopment only goes so far and my sense of duty goes farther so i burn out then in a depressed mode i land in basic pleasure with higher mood after building basic pleasures i grade them up to high pleasures from which point i have more confidence in my ability to develop related skills the cycle restarts this is very interesting to me but all ive really done is describe a pattern of disordered mood change in terms of its effects on human interest and concern and apply conceptions of general human interests and concern in doing so but i actually think i have a lifestyle tip for myself based on this theory im at the high level of the personal development stage right now and could approach an abnormal sense of duty first of all by recognizing this generalized progression i can catch any slip ups early and so can my support circle but what really interests me is how i can adjust my personal development habits toward a more healthy progression right now my personal development topic is math math is an extremely broad topic in terms of range of difficulty and scope i could get frustrated with basic algebra or i could obsess over an unsolved problem way out of my league but i think about another personal development habit i had weight loss when i lost weight it was a development of daily regiment one where i ate a little less every day and gradually lost weight normally i have a seasonal peak of hypomania where i have that grandiose duty after the regimented challenge of losing weight became difficult i went to a modestly fairly euthymic basic pleasure the nature of the challenge didnt involve runaway progress because of how structured it was applying that lesson to my math development i could continue to over stress myself with difficult problems or i could make it a daily grind i could even get a tutor to make sure i stay on a good track perhaps i wouldnt have to go to a toxic level of stimulation and go hypomanic and just cool off adding a daily practice to my life thinking this way has opened up some different options about how to deal with my moods as well as who i really am i see my doctor tomorrow and i look forward to discussing these ideas with him note about high and low pleasures i didnt mean to call anyones hobby high or low i think its completely relative i think something high for me could be low for someone else i strongly believe whether a pleasure is high or low at least in a mental health context depends on the kind of enjoyment one gets out of it its something one can really know if one really asks themselves and is honest,bipolar,bipolar,bipolar

who else here is limerant just wanting to get an idea of the number of people who are limerant for unavailable people for me its always a man in a teaching or mentorship position who is married married because that means im safe hes not going to act im not going to act there isnt going to be a relationship the attraction is just going to float in the air like a butterfly such intense but unattainable beauty so much out of reach i am in close almost daily contact with such a man its annoying me because i know its hopeless and could never go anywhere but i am addicted to it addicted to any little morsel of recognition he gives me addicted to making him laugh it makes my day to make him laugh he has no idea about the depth of my feelings because i am a person with avpd and i know how to hide my emotions even lie about them and shut everything down my brain is basically screaming stay safe stay safe i dont know who i am more annoyed with me or him i think making him laugh is the way i make him comfortable with my attraction to him its like it must be pretty obvious im basically broadcasting i dont love you im just an awkward friendly doofus please like me it is intensely sad to me that this is the closest i will get to love but even that is addictive sad beauty sad beauty is better than the grey anhedonia i am used to i hope this makes sense i hope someone understands or can relate,personality_disorder,personality_disorder,personality_disorder

paradoxical cycle of my past present and future and suicidal ideation hi guys so i am a bipolar and i havent actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity anyway i believe being a bipolar affects the way i am thinking and the decisions i make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later so my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger this depressive episode is the worst so far i live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments i am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because i miss these moments so much and miss the people that i dont see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that i couldnt really do anything about it my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time and my future which l do think about but dont care about it anymore sometimes i used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so thinking about what i could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me it just converts me from a happy person to a sad desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation mostly to overdose to death but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide i cant even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well sometimes i just get the good parts of the memories while other times i just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university losing my best friend losing my boyfriend etc i just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones it just feels like getting stabbed in the back these many emotions and mixedup thoughts i get give me a headache and usually panic attacks that sometimes i cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well i also have adhd social phobia and severe trust issues i now feel so bad that i wish this world to stop and my life ends thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know so ive been asking if i am alone on this does anyone relate to my experience,bipolar,bipolar,bipolar

anxiety stopping me from working ive been dealing with anxiety for a while now i came to the realisation a few years ago that it has mainly stemmed from the relationship with my dad i had when i was younger this is caused me to not be able to do tasks in front of people wether they be simple or not i just cant do it i start lightly trembling and thinking about how stupid i must look to whoever is watching me this causes me to mess up even more this is really stopped me from wanting to go out and get a job because i know that if the interview goes well i actually do good in interviews weirdly then i will eventually have to be shadowed and critiqued by someone while i learn the job this dread has stopped me from going to interviews now does anyone else get this sorry for the long post,anxiety,anxiety,anxiety
